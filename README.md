**ram-sentinel** is a userspace OOM (Out-of-Memory) prevention daemon designed specifically for modern workstations. Unlike `earlyoom` or `nohang` which often act as blunt instruments (killing your heaviest app, usually your Browser or IDE), `ram-sentinel` uses **Surgical Cmdline Process Targeting** and **Pressure Stall Information (PSI)** to surgically remove specific low-value targets (like browser renderer tabs) before threatening your main workflow.

It runs as a standard user (`systemd --user`), requires no root privileges, and talks to you via desktop notifications.


## 🚀 Why You Need This

If you are tired of your system freezing for 30 seconds before suddenly closing your entire game or browser, this tool is for you.

| Feature         | Standard OOM Killer (systemd-oomd)                           | RAM Sentinel                                                               |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Targeting**   | Kills the parent process (Largest RSS). **Bye bye Browser.** | Targeted snipe. Kills `type=renderer` tabs first. **Keeps Browser alive.** |
| **Trigger**     | RAM Full (Too late) or blunt heuristic.                      | **PSI (Pressure)**: Acts when system *stutters*, not just when full.       |
| **Safety**      | Can kill PID that was just reused (Race condition).          | **PID Identity Check**: Verifies process start time before killing.        |
| **UX**          | Silent death.                                                | **Notifications**: Warns you *before* killing. Tells you *what* it killed. |
| **Permissions** | Root required.                                               | **Userspace**: Runs as YOU.                                                |

## ⚡ Quick Start (Sane Defaults)

You don't have to configure anything to get started. `ram-sentinel` ships with **[Sane Defaults](#sane-defaults-🛡️)** that work for 99% of desktop users.

### Installation

```bash
cargo install ram-sentinel
````

### Run immediately

```bash
ram-sentinel
```

### Enable as a Service (Recommended)

Generate a systemd unit and enable it:

```bash
# Preview the unit file 
ram-sentinel --print-systemd-user-unit

# Install and Enable
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
ram-sentinel --print-systemd-user-unit ~/.config/systemd/user/ram-sentinel.service
# edit if necessary
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now ram-sentinel
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

`ram-sentinel` looks for a config file in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ram-sentinel.yaml` (usually `~/.config/ram-sentinel.yaml`).

### 🌟 Recommended Configuration

*Use this if you want the "Anti-Freeze" experience.* This enables the PSI monitor to kill runaway processes when the system starts thrashing (lagging), even if you technically have free RAM.

```yaml
ram:
  warnMinFreeBytes: 500M
  # Safety net: Kill if RAM drops below 5%
  killMinFreePercent: 5.0 
psi:
  # Warn when system feels "heavy" (stuttering)
  warnMaxPercent: 40.0
  # EMERGENCY: Kill when system freezes (mouse lag/thrashing)
  killMaxPercent: 85.0
  amountToFree: 400M
checkIntervalMs: 1000
warnResetMs: 30000
sigtermWaitMs: 2500
ignoreNames:
  # Broad matches to protect your shell/environment
  - kwin
  - plasma
  - gnome-shell
  - sshd
killTargets:
  # TIER 1 PRIORITY: The Expendables
  # These are killed FIRST.
  - type=renderer       # Chrome/Electron tabs
  - -contentproc        # Firefox tabs
  - ^/usr/bin/node      # Strict prefix match for local node scripts
killStrategy: highestOomScore
```

### Sane Defaults 🛡️

If no config file is found, `ram-sentinel` loads this configuration automatically. It is conservative and focuses on preventing hard lockups.

```yaml
ram:
  warnMinFreePercent: 10.0
  killMinFreePercent: 5.0
psi: {} # PSI disabled by default to be safe
checkIntervalMs: 1000
warnResetMs: 30000
sigtermWaitMs: 5000
killTargets:
  - type=renderer
  - -contentproc
ignoreNames: []
killStrategy: highestOomScore
```

### 📖 Full Configuration Reference

Detailed explanation of every available option.

```yaml
# --- RAM LIMITS ---
# Triggers if Available RAM falls below these values.
# NOTE: If 'Bytes' is set, it OVERRIDES 'Percent'.
ram:
  warnMinFreeBytes: 1G      # Warn if < 1GB free
  warnMinFreePercent: 10.0  # (Ignored if Bytes is set)
  killMinFreeBytes: 250M    # Kill if < 250MB free
  killMinFreePercent: 5.0   # (Ignored if Bytes is set)

# --- SWAP LIMITS ---
# Same logic as RAM.
swap:
  warnMinFreePercent: 20.0
  killMinFreePercent: 5.0

# --- PSI (PRESSURE STALL INFORMATION) ---
# Requires Linux Kernel 4.20+ with CONFIG_PSI=y
# "Pressure" = % of time tasks are stalled waiting for memory.
psi:
  warnMaxPercent: 40.0      # Warn if system is stuttering (40% pressure)
  killMaxPercent: 90.0      # Kill if system is frozen (90% pressure)
  amountToFree: 500M        # If triggered, kill processes until 500MB is freed

# --- TIMING ---
checkIntervalMs: 1000       # How often to poll system stats
warnResetMs: 30000          # Don't spam notifications more than every 30s
sigtermWaitMs: 3000         # Wait 3s after SIGTERM before sending SIGKILL

# --- TARGETING STRATEGY ---
# 1. Regex: "/pattern/" matches Name or Command Line
# 2. Prefix: "^string" matches START of Command Line
# 3. Literal: "string" matches substring of Name
killTargets:
  - type=renderer           # Priority 1: Browser tabs
  - /npm start/             # Priority 2: NPM scripts
  - ^/usr/bin/python        # Priority 3: Python scripts

ignoreNames:
  - ^Xorg                   # Never kill Xorg
  - /wayland/               # Never kill Wayland compositors

# Strategies: 'highestOomScore' (recommended) or 'largestRss'
killStrategy: highestOomScore
```

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

`ram-sentinel` is built on the **Safety First** doctrine.

1.  **Priority Queues:** We define a priority system for processes. `killTargets` are "Second Class Citizens"—they are always sacrificed first. Your main apps are only touched if shedding the expendables didn't solve the memory crisis.
2.  **Identity Verification:** Before sending the final `SIGKILL`, the sentinel verifies that the PID's `create_time` matches the victim it selected 3 seconds ago. This prevents the "PID Reuse" race condition where a guardian accidentally kills a brand new process that grabbed the dead victim's PID.
3.  **Strict Override:** Configuration follows a "Manual Override" logic. If you set a specific Byte limit (`500MB`), the vague Percentage limit (`5%`) is ignored. You get exactly what you ask for.

> `ram-sentinel` is heavily inspired by the excellent [`earlyoom`](https://github.com/rfjakob/earlyoom), implementing many features I wished it had (like surgical process targeting and fine grained tuning).For a deeper dive into the architectural decisions, see [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md).
